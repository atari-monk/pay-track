1. Project Structure
    - based on story and architecture propose monorepo structure with services and package.json
    - use latest typescript and pnpm
    - in this step do only must have config files for monorepo and service user-service so we can start implementing it next
2. Check my code base and file 2026-01-13-monorepo-structure-proposal.md. Is implemented structure same as in doc ?
3. Plan for incremantal implementation of user-service, feature by feature
